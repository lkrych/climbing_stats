# Testing with Pytest

[I used this link to structure my tests](https://www.patricksoftwareblog.com/testing-a-flask-application-using-pytest/)

I've separate the tests into unit tests and functional tests.

The unit tests make assertions about specific functions or objects.

The functional tests test the behavior of the application overall.
