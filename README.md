{
  "access_token": "<ACCESS TOKEN GOES HERE>"

curl -d '{"username":"blah", "email":"blahblah@blah.com", "password":"blahblah"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:5000/users

curl -H "Authorization: JWT <ACCESS TOKEN GOES HERE>" http://localhost:5000/user/1/workout/2
```

    curl localhost:5000/user/1
